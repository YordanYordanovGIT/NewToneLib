# NewToneLib
NewToneLib is a simple library, intended for devices which do not support built-in tone() function.

NOTE: tone() function does not support using multiple pins simultaneously.

Tested on the following devices:
  -NodeMCU v1.0(ESP-12E) with ESP8266
  -Arduino Due
  
Feel free to report any issue you encounter with the library and test on another devices.
Any help would be appreciated. :)
